3. **Iterative Reviews:** Review after each major revision
4. **Document Findings:** Export review reports for audit trails
5. **Address All Failures:** Resolve all failed items before proceeding to HARA
6. **Use Templates:** Generate templates for consistent manual reviews

---

## INTEGRATION TIPS

**After Item Definition Development:**
1. Save generated Item Definition to file
2. Place in item_definition_to_review/ folder
3. Run review to ensure compliance
4. Fix any identified issues
5. Re-review until 100% compliant
6. Proceed to HARA Assistant

**For External Documents:**
1. Convert to supported format (.txt, .docx, .pdf)
2. Ensure text is readable (not scanned images)
3. Place in review folder
4. Run review
5. Provide feedback to document author

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue:** "No Item Definition Found"
- **Solution:** Verify file is in `item_definition_to_review/` folder
- Check file format is .txt, .docx, or .pdf
- Ensure only one file is present

**Issue:** Review reports incomplete sections as "Pass"
- **Solution:** Check that document has clear section headings
- Ensure content is properly formatted
- Verify file encoding is UTF-8

**Issue:** Review takes too long
- **Solution:** Large documents (>50 pages) may take time
- Consider splitting into smaller sections
- Check LLM service availability

---

## LIMITATIONS

- Reviews text content only (cannot assess diagrams/tables in detail)
- Requires human expert validation for technical correctness
- Checklist covers common requirements (may need customization for specific projects)
- Not a replacement for formal technical review by qualified personnel

---

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

**Planned Features:**
- Boundary diagram review capability
- Multi-sheet Excel workbook support
- Integration with Item Definition Developer for direct review
- Automated correction suggestions
- Custom checklist editor
